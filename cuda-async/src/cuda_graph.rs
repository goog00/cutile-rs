///
/// # Safety proof: why `record` is safe
///
/// A CUDA data race occurs when two accesses to the same device memory
/// are unordered and at least one is a write. This is UB per both CUDA
/// and Rust.
///
/// `record` is safe because of two complementary mechanisms:
///
/// ## Capture mode prevents concurrent GPU execution
///
/// The scope's stream is in **capture mode** during the closure (via
/// `cuStreamBeginCapture`). In capture mode:
///
/// 1. **No GPU work executes.** `record` records operations as graph
///    nodes — kernels are not launched, memcpys are not issued. There
///    is no in-flight GPU work that could race with anything.
///
/// 2. **Same-stream ordering is preserved.** All `record` calls go to
///    the same capture stream. When the graph is later launched via
///    [`CudaGraph::launch`], the nodes execute in recorded order on a
///    single stream. Sequential same-stream execution is ordered — no
///    data races.
///
/// 3. **Cross-stream operations during capture are harmless.** If the
///    user calls `op.sync_on(&other_stream)` inside the closure, that
///    work executes eagerly on `other_stream` — but no captured work is
///    executing concurrently (the capture stream is recording, not
///    running). At graph launch time, the eagerly-executed work is long
///    complete. No overlap, no race.
///
/// 4. **`sync_on` on the capture stream fails at runtime.** CUDA returns
///    `CUDA_ERROR_STREAM_CAPTURE_UNSUPPORTED` if you try to synchronize
///    a stream that is capturing.
///
/// 5. **Borrow checker enforces `&mut` exclusivity.** `record` consumes
///    the op, releasing `&mut`. The next `record` can then borrow the
///    same buffer as `&` for reading.
///
/// ## `GraphNode` prevents allocation during capture
///
/// `record` accepts [`GraphNode`] (not [`DeviceOp`]). `GraphNode` is only
/// implemented by operations that do not allocate or free device memory
/// (kernel launches, `memcpy`, `value`). This prevents:
///
/// - **Address instability:** `cuMemAllocAsync` during capture allocates
///   memory, but on replay the allocation node may return a different
///   address. Subsequent nodes bake in the capture-time pointer — UB.
///
/// - **Uninitialized reads:** An allocation during capture gives the user
///   a tensor handle. The initialization (e.g., memset from `zeros`) was
///   recorded, not executed. Passing the tensor to `sync_on(&other_stream)`
///   reads uninitialized memory.
///
/// - **Invalid frees:** If a tensor allocated inside the scope is dropped,
///   `cuMemFreeAsync` is recorded. On replay, it frees the capture-time
///   address, which may no longer be valid.
///
/// Since no tensors can be allocated inside the scope, all buffers are
/// pre-allocated and passed in via borrows. No tensor created inside
/// the scope means no tensor dropped inside the scope.
///
/// # What happens if you call other operations inside the closure
///
/// While `s.record(op)` is the intended API, other operations inside
/// the closure have well-defined behavior:
///
/// | Operation | What happens |
/// |---|---|
/// | `op.sync_on(&capture_stream)` | Runtime error from CUDA driver |
/// | `op.sync_on(&other_stream)` | Executes eagerly outside the graph — no race (see point 3) |
/// | `op.sync()` | May pick the capture stream (error) or another stream (executes eagerly) |
///
/// These are all defined behavior but serve no purpose inside a graph
/// capture scope — use `s.record(op)` instead.
///
/// # Thread safety
///
/// `Scope` is `!Send` — it cannot escape to another thread.
///
/// See `.internal/cuda-graph-redesign/SAFETY_PROOF_CUDA_GRAPH.md` for the full
/// formal proof.
